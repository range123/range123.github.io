<!-- 1. **Dino-Run (Present),** ​ A ​ **_Reinforcement-Learning_** ​ agent that will play the well known
    google chrome browser game, a convolutional agent will be trained for playing the
    game. -->
1. **MCQ Generation using Text Transformers (2021)**, A fully functioning web app
    which can generate multiple choice based questions from a given piece of text and
    also functions as an intelligent editor for MCQs. The core generator works using a
    fine-tuned T5 model & a distractor generator model, Presented as the final year
    engineering project.
2. **Deep Generative Models for Faces (2020)** ​, A Project aimed at generating faces
    and evaluating different generative models such as Auto-Encoders, GANs, VAEs etc.
    the models are trained on the ​ _Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset_ ​.
3. **MalwareDetection (2020)**, A MachineLearning based project for predicting if a program is malicious by using  the string representation for the program. An ML based approach was also used for detecting **__BotNets__** in network traffic, Submitted for IIT Kanpur Cybersecurity Hackathon.
4. **RangeBot** ​ **(2020)** ​, A Bot that plays chess using ​ **_Alpha-Beta Pruning_** ​ and Endgame
    TableBases. It makes use of a creative heuristic function for searching the board
    states. Attained Peak performance of 1600 elo.
5. **See-In-The-Dark** ​ **(2019),** ​ A Web-App that uses a ​ **_Fully-Convolutional neural_**
    **_network_** ​ to Brighten Dark Images with little loss in information and essentially allow
    us to see in the dark, built for MLH local hack day.


6. **Flight Delay Prediction** ​ using Machine Learning ​ **(2019)** ​, A project to predict whether
    a flight will be delayed using the relevant weather data and to test the accuracy of the
    different Classifiers and Regressors on the data.
7. **Dr. Plip** ​ **(2019),** ​ A prototype chat bot that simulates a psychiatrist and suggests
    solutions to common mental health problems, developed at Yet Another Hackathon
    held at SVCE.
8. **Face ID** ​ **(2018),** ​ A Mobile App for detecting and keeping track of faces by checking
    the cosine similarity of the Embedded vectors for faces. The embeddings are
    generated using a pre trained model.^
9. **LocationPin** ​ **(2017),** ​ A Mobile App for Real-Time Location Sharing/Pinning over the
    internet.
