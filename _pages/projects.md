1. **Dino-Run (Present),** ​ A ​ **_Reinforcement-Learning_** ​ agent that will play the well known
    google chrome browser game, a convolutional agent will be trained for playing the
    game.
2. **Deep Generative Models for Faces (Present)** ​, A Project aimed at generating faces
    and evaluating different generative models such as Auto-Encoders, GANs, VAEs etc.
    the models are trained on the ​ _Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset_ ​.
3. **Temperature-Monitor (Present),** ​ An IOT based project for continuously Monitoring
    the temperature of Mortar blocks using Arduino and thermocouples to analyse its
    physical properties, done as an Internally Funded Project.
4. **RangeBot** ​ **(2020)** ​, A Bot that plays chess using ​ **_Alpha-Beta Pruning_** ​ and Endgame
    TableBases. It makes use of a creative heuristic function for searching the board
    states. Attained Peak performance of 1600 elo.
5. **See-In-The-Dark** ​ **(2019),** ​ A Web-App that uses a ​ **_Fully-Convolutional neural_**
    **_network_** ​ to Brighten Dark Images with little loss in information and essentially allow
    us to see in the dark, built for MLH local hack day.


6. **Flight Delay Prediction** ​ using Machine Learning ​ **(2019)** ​, A project to predict whether
    a flight will be delayed using the relevant weather data and to test the accuracy of the
    different Classifiers and Regressors on the data.
7. **Dr. Plip** ​ **(2019),** ​ A prototype chat bot that simulates a psychiatrist and suggests
    solutions to common mental health problems, developed at Yet Another Hackathon
    held at SVCE.
8. **Face ID** ​ **(2018),** ​ A Mobile App for detecting and keeping track of faces by checking
    the cosine similarity of the Embedded vectors for faces. The embeddings are
    generated using a pre trained model.^
9. **LocationPin** ​ **(2017),** ​ A Mobile App for Real-Time Location Sharing/Pinning over the
    internet.
