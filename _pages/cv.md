## EXPERIENCE


- Interned at ​ **Leankloud Solutions** (2020 April-June), ​worked on generating sizing
recommendations for Virtual Machines and Load Balancers on AWS.
                       The Memory and Cpu resources required for virtual machines are
predicted (using SVM) based on the constraint on response time. Built a Flask
endpoint for the same.
                       Also built a framework which fits multiple Machine Learning models on the
given VM data and determines if it is possible to size the virtual machine based on the
response time.
- Interned at ​ **Exeter Premedia Services** (2019 December), ​worked on a document
parser which classifies Research papers, extracts a relevant summary and a set of key
words from the document using pre trained Transformers (Sequence Models).
                                            Extracted sentences from the Research Papers as features and Made
use of a pre-trained transformer (​ BERT) ​ to perform the summarization.

## PROJECTS

1. **Dino-Run (Present),** ​ A ​ **_Reinforcement-Learning_** ​ agent that will play the well known
    google chrome browser game, a convolutional agent will be trained for playing the
    game.
2. **Deep Generative Models for Faces (Present)** ​, A Project aimed at generating faces
    and evaluating different generative models such as Auto-Encoders, GANs, VAEs etc.
    the models are trained on the ​ _Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset_ ​.
3. **Temperature-Monitor (Present),** ​ An IOT based project for continuously Monitoring
    the temperature of Mortar blocks using Arduino and thermocouples to analyse its
    physical properties, done as an Internally Funded Project.
4. **RangeBot** ​ **(2020)** ​, A Bot that plays chess using ​ **_Alpha-Beta Pruning_** ​ and Endgame
    TableBases. It makes use of a creative heuristic function for searching the board
    states. Attained Peak performance of 1600 elo.
5. **See-In-The-Dark** ​ **(2019),** ​ A Web-App that uses a ​ **_Fully-Convolutional neural_**
    **_network_** ​ to Brighten Dark Images with little loss in information and essentially allow
    us to see in the dark, built for MLH local hack day.


6. **Flight Delay Prediction** ​ using Machine Learning ​ **(2019)** ​, A project to predict whether
    a flight will be delayed using the relevant weather data and to test the accuracy of the
    different Classifiers and Regressors on the data.
7. **Dr. Plip** ​ **(2019),** ​ A prototype chat bot that simulates a psychiatrist and suggests
    solutions to common mental health problems, developed at Yet Another Hackathon
    held at SVCE.
8. **Face ID** ​ **(2018),** ​ A Mobile App for detecting and keeping track of faces by checking
    the cosine similarity of the Embedded vectors for faces. The embeddings are
    generated using a pre trained model.^
9. **LocationPin** ​ **(2017),** ​ A Mobile App for Real-Time Location Sharing/Pinning over the
    internet.
